# BLE Hanging Issues Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The mmrelay error showed:
```
ERROR:root:Error during BLE client shutdown: BLE client is shutting down
RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'BLEClient._stop_event_loop' was never awaited
```

This was caused by trying to call an async method (`_stop_event_loop`) from a synchronous context during shutdown.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Async/Sync Mismatch**: The `close()` method was trying to call `self.async_run(self._stop_event_loop())` but the `async_run()` method was checking the shutdown flag and raising an exception.
2. **Coroutine Never Awaited**: The async `_stop_event_loop()` method was being scheduled but never properly awaited.
3. **Premature Shutdown Flag**: The shutdown flag was being set too early, preventing proper cleanup operations.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed BLEClient.close() Method
**Before:**
```python
def close(self):
    self._shutdown_flag = True
    self.async_run(self._stop_event_loop())  # This caused the error
```

**After:**
```python
def close(self):
    if self._shutdown_flag:
        return
    self._shutdown_flag = True
    
    # Cancel all pending futures first
    for future in list(self._pending_tasks):
        if not future.done():
            future.cancel()
    self._pending_tasks.clear()
    
    # Schedule the event loop shutdown safely
    if self._eventLoop and not self._eventLoop.is_closed():
        self._eventLoop.call_soon_threadsafe(self._eventLoop.stop)
```

### 2. Simplified async_run() Method
**Before:**
```python
def async_run(self, coro):
    if self._shutdown_flag:
        raise RuntimeError("BLE client is shutting down")  # This blocked shutdown
    return asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(coro, self._eventLoop)
```

**After:**
```python
def async_run(self, coro):
    return asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(coro, self._eventLoop)
```

### 3. Improved Future Cancellation
**Before:**
```python
except Exception:
    future.cancel()  # Could cancel already done futures
```

**After:**
```python
except Exception:
    if not future.done():
        future.cancel()  # Only cancel if not already done
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Thread-Safe Shutdown**: Uses `call_soon_threadsafe()` to safely stop the event loop from another thread
2. **Proper Future Management**: Cancels pending futures before shutdown and checks if they're done before cancelling
3. **No Async/Sync Mixing**: Eliminates the problematic async method call from sync context
4. **Race Condition Prevention**: Maintains shutdown flag to prevent multiple shutdown attempts
5. **Clean Resource Cleanup**: Ensures all pending tasks are properly cancelled

## Testing Results
- ✅ All shutdown improvements present in code
- ✅ No problematic async patterns found
- ✅ All shutdown logic improvements implemented
- ✅ All error handling improvements present

### 4. Enhanced Thread Safety and Robustness
**Signal Handler Fix:**
```python
def signal_handler(sig, frame):
    logging.info("Received shutdown signal, exiting gracefully...")
    # Raise a KeyboardInterrupt to allow the main loop to exit gracefully
    raise KeyboardInterrupt()
```

**Thread-Safe Task Management:**
```python
self._pending_tasks_lock = threading.Lock()

# In close():
with self._pending_tasks_lock:
    tasks_to_cancel = list(self._pending_tasks)
    self._pending_tasks.clear()

# In async_await():
with self._pending_tasks_lock:
    self._pending_tasks.add(future)
# ... later ...
with self._pending_tasks_lock:
    self._pending_tasks.discard(future)
```

**Guaranteed Resource Cleanup:**
```python
try:
    self.client.disconnect()
except Exception as e:
    logging.error(f"Error disconnecting BLE client: {e}")
finally:
    # Ensure the client is closed and resources are released
    self.client.close()
    self.client = None
```

## Expected Outcome
This comprehensive fix should resolve:
- ✅ The "coroutine was never awaited" warning in mmrelay
- ✅ BLE hanging issues during Ctrl+C interruption
- ✅ Clean shutdown of BLE connections in services
- ✅ Proper cleanup of async resources during shutdown
- ✅ Race conditions in task management
- ✅ Inconsistent signal handling behavior
- ✅ Resource leaks during error conditions

The fix maintains all the original improvements (timeouts, task tracking, error handling) while resolving the async/sync execution issue and adding robust thread safety measures.
