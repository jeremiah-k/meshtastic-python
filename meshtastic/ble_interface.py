Exception Handling Philosophy for BLE Interface

This interface follows a structured approach to exception handling:

1. **Expected, recoverable failures**: Caught, logged, and operation continues
   - Corrupted protobuf packets (DecodeError) - discarded gracefully
   - Optional notification failures (log notifications) - logged but non-critical
   - Temporary BLE disconnections - handled by auto-reconnect logic

2. **Expected, non-recoverable failures**: Caught, logged, and re-raised or handled gracefully
   - Connection establishment failures - clear error messages to user
   - Service discovery failures - retry with fallback mechanisms

3. **Critical failures**: Let bubble up to notify developers
   - FROMNUM_UUID notification setup failure - essential for packet reception
   - Unexpected BLE errors during critical operations

4. **Cleanup operations**: Failures are logged but don't raise exceptions
   - Thread shutdown, client close operations - best-effort cleanup

This approach ensures the library is resilient to expected wireless communication
issues while making critical failures visible to developers.

    MeshInterface using BLE to connect to Meshtastic devices.

    This class provides a complete BLE interface for Meshtastic communication,
    handling connection management, packet transmission/reception, error recovery,
    and automatic reconnection. It extends MeshInterface with BLE-specific
    functionality while maintaining API compatibility.

    Key Features:
        - Automatic connection management and recovery
        - Thread-safe operations with centralized thread coordination
        - Unified error handling and logging
        - Configurable timeouts and retry behavior
        - Support for both legacy and modern BLE characteristics
        - Comprehensive state management

    Architecture:
        - ThreadCoordinator: Centralized thread and event management
        - Module-level constants: Configurable timeouts, UUIDs, and error messages
        - BLEErrorHandler: Standardized error handling patterns
        - ConnectionState: Enum-based state tracking

    Note: This interface requires appropriate Bluetooth permissions and may
    need platform-specific setup for BLE operations.
