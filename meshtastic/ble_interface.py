Exception Handling Philosophy for BLE Interface

This interface follows a structured approach to exception handling:

1. **Expected, recoverable failures**: Caught, logged, and operation continues
   - Corrupted protobuf packets (DecodeError) - discarded gracefully
   - Optional notification failures (log notifications) - logged but non-critical
   - Temporary BLE disconnections - handled by auto-reconnect logic

2. **Expected, non-recoverable failures**: Caught, logged, and re-raised or handled gracefully
   - Connection establishment failures - clear error messages to user
   - Service discovery failures - retry with fallback mechanisms

3. **Critical failures**: Let bubble up to notify developers
   - FROMNUM_UUID notification setup failure - essential for packet reception
   - Unexpected BLE errors during critical operations

4. **Cleanup operations**: Failures are logged but don't raise exceptions
   - Thread shutdown, client close operations - best-effort cleanup

This approach ensures the library is resilient to expected wireless communication
issues while making critical failures visible to developers.

class BLEInterface(MeshInterface):
    """
    MeshInterface using BLE to connect to Meshtastic devices.

    This class provides a complete BLE interface for Meshtastic communication,
    handling connection management, packet transmission/reception, error recovery,
    and automatic reconnection. It extends MeshInterface with BLE-specific
    functionality while maintaining API compatibility.

    Key Features:
        - Automatic connection management and recovery
        - Thread-safe operations with centralized thread coordination
        - Unified error handling and logging
        - Configurable timeouts and retry behavior
        - Support for both legacy and modern BLE characteristics
        - Comprehensive state management

    Architecture:
        - ThreadCoordinator: Centralized thread and event management
        - Module-level constants: Configurable timeouts, UUIDs, and error messages
        - BLEErrorHandler: Standardized error handling patterns
        - ConnectionState: Enum-based state tracking

    Note: This interface requires appropriate Bluetooth permissions and may
    need platform-specific setup for BLE operations.
