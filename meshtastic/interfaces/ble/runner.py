"""Singleton asyncio runner for BLE operations.

This module provides a singleton `BLECoroutineRunner` that manages a single,
long-lived background thread running an asyncio event loop for all BLE
operations.

Notes
-----
- Reduces resource usage by avoiding per-client thread and loop creation.
- Prevents zombie-thread accumulation.
- Simplifies cleanup and shutdown.
- Provides consistent event-loop management across all BLE clients.

      - The background thread starts on first coroutine submission.
      - The runner registers an atexit handler for graceful shutdown.
      - If the loop crashes, it is automatically restarted on next use.
