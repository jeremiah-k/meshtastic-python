    """
    MeshInterface using BLE to connect to Meshtastic devices.

    This class provides a complete BLE interface for Meshtastic communication,
    handling connection management, packet transmission/reception, error recovery,
    and automatic reconnection. It extends MeshInterface with BLE-specific
    functionality while maintaining API compatibility.

    Key Features:
        - Automatic connection management and recovery
        - Thread-safe operations with centralized thread coordination
        - Unified error handling and logging
        - Configurable timeouts and retry behavior
        - Support for both legacy and modern BLE characteristics
        - Comprehensive state management

    Architecture:
        - BLEStateManager: Centralized connection state machine with shared locking
        - ThreadCoordinator: Thread/event lifecycle and coordination utilities
        - BLEErrorHandler: Standardized error handling patterns
        - NotificationManager: Tracks active notifications for reconnect-safe resubscription
        - DiscoveryManager: Scans and falls back to connected-device enumeration
        - ConnectionValidator: Enforces connection preconditions
        - ClientManager: Owns BLEClient lifecycle and cleanup operations
        - ConnectionOrchestrator: Coordinates connection establishment
        - ReconnectScheduler / ReconnectWorker: Policy-driven reconnect attempts

    Note: This interface requires appropriate Bluetooth permissions and may
    need platform-specific setup for BLE operations.
