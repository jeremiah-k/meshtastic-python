# BLE Interface Refactoring Plan

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive plan to refactor the BLE interface (`meshtastic/ble_interface.py`) to reduce complexity while maintaining all functionality and robust connection handling. The goal is to reduce the current 1211 lines to approximately 900-1000 lines while preserving production-ready reliability.

## Current Complexity Analysis

### Primary Complexity Sources

1. **Excessive Lock Usage**: 3 separate locks (`_closing_lock`, `_client_lock`, `_connect_lock`)
2. **Duplicate Disconnect Logic**: `_on_ble_disconnect()` and `_handle_read_loop_disconnect()` with overlapping functionality
3. **Verbose Error Handling**: Repetitive try/catch patterns throughout the codebase
4. **Complex State Management**: Multiple boolean flags and events for coordination
5. **Thread Management Overhead**: Complex thread coordination and cleanup procedures
6. **Scattered Constants**: 20+ configuration constants distributed throughout the file

### Current Metrics
- **Lines of Code**: 1211
- **Methods**: ~30 methods
- **Lock Objects**: 3 separate locks
- **Event Objects**: 3+ events for coordination
- **Test Coverage**: 12 comprehensive tests (1433 lines)

## Refactoring Strategy

### Guiding Principles

1. **Preserve All Functionality**: No feature regression, maintain robust error handling
2. **Maintain Test Coverage**: All existing tests must continue to pass
3. **Improve Maintainability**: Simpler code structure with clearer intent
4. **Reduce Cognitive Load**: Fewer moving parts, easier to understand flow
5. **Keep Production Ready**: Maintain Linux D-Bus support and comprehensive error handling

## Detailed Refactoring Plan

### Phase 1: State Management Consolidation

#### 1.1 Replace Multiple Locks with Unified State Management

**Current Approach:**
```python
self._closing_lock: Lock = Lock()  # Prevents concurrent close operations
self._client_lock: Lock = Lock()   # Protects client access during reconnection
self._connect_lock: Lock = Lock()  # Prevents concurrent connection attempts
```

**Planned Approach (DEFERRED):**
```python
from enum import Enum
from threading import RLock

class ConnectionState(Enum):
    DISCONNECTED = "disconnected"
    CONNECTING = "connecting"
    CONNECTED = "connected"
    CLOSING = "closing"
    CLOSED = "closed"

class BLEInterface(MeshInterface):
    def __init__(self, ...):
        self._state_lock = RLock()  # Single reentrant lock for all state changes
        self._state = ConnectionState.DISCONNECTED
        self._client: Optional["BLEClient"] = None
```

**Implementation Note:** The consolidation to a single RLock and ConnectionState enum has been **deferred** to a later phase. The current implementation retains the three-lock approach to preserve the battle-tested lock hierarchy and minimize refactoring risk. Future consolidation may be considered after the current refactoring proves stable in production.

**Planned Benefits (when implemented):**
- Reduces from 3 locks to 1 reentrant lock
- Eliminates potential deadlocks
- Clearer state transitions
- Easier to reason about thread safety

#### 1.2 Consolidate State Flags

**Current Approach:**
```python
self._closing: bool = False
self._disconnect_notified: bool = False
self._want_receive: bool = True
```

**Refactored Approach:**
```python
@property
def is_closing(self) -> bool:
    return self._state in (ConnectionState.CLOSING, ConnectionState.CLOSED)

@property
def is_connected(self) -> bool:
    return self._state == ConnectionState.CONNECTED

@property
def should_receive(self) -> bool:
    return self._state in (ConnectionState.CONNECTED, ConnectionState.CONNECTING)
```

### Phase 2: Unified Disconnect Handling

#### 2.1 Create Single Disconnect Handler

**Current Approach:**
- `_on_ble_disconnect()` - Handles bleak callback
- `_handle_read_loop_disconnect()` - Handles read loop disconnects
- Duplicate logic for client cleanup and reconnection

**Refactored Approach:**
```python
def _handle_disconnect(self, source: str, client: Optional["BLEClient"] = None) -> None:
    """
    Unified disconnect handling from any source.
    
    Args:
        source: Description of disconnect source ("bleak_callback", "read_loop", etc.)
        client: The client that disconnected (if available)
    """
    with self._state_lock:
        if self._state in (ConnectionState.CLOSING, ConnectionState.CLOSED):
            logger.debug(f"Ignoring disconnect from {source} - already closing")
            return
            
        # Check for stale client
        if client and client is not self._client:
            logger.debug(f"Ignoring stale disconnect from {source}")
            return
            
        # Update state and cleanup
        previous_client = self._client
        self._client = None
        self._state = ConnectionState.DISCONNECTED
        
        # Notify parent if not already notified
        if not self._disconnect_notified:
            self._disconnect_notified = True
            self._disconnected()
    
    # Cleanup outside lock to avoid holding during operations
    if previous_client:
        self._safe_close_client(previous_client)
    
    logger.info(f"BLE disconnected: {source}")
    
    # Handle reconnection
    if self.auto_reconnect:
        self._schedule_auto_reconnect()
    else:
        self._close_interface()
```

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates code duplication
- Single source of truth for disconnect handling
- Consistent behavior across all disconnect scenarios
- Easier to test and maintain

### Phase 3: Error Handling Simplification

#### 3.1 Create Error Handling Helpers

**Current Approach:**
```python
try:
    client.close()
except BleakError:
    logger.debug("BLE-specific error during client close", exc_info=True)
except (RuntimeError, OSError):
    logger.debug("OS/Runtime error during client close", exc_info=True)
```

**Refactored Approach:**
```python
def _safe_execute(self, operation: str, func, *args, **kwargs) -> Any:
    """
    Safely execute an operation with consistent error handling.
    
    Args:
        operation: Description of the operation for logging
        func: Function to execute
        *args, **kwargs: Arguments to pass to func
    
    Returns:
        Result of func() if it succeeds.
    
    Raises:
        self.BLEError: Wrapped and re-raised for BLE/DBus/system/unexpected errors.
    """
    try:
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    except BleakDBusError as e:
        logger.debug(f"D-Bus error during {operation}: {e}")
        raise self.BLEError(f"Bluetooth D-Bus error during {operation}") from e
    except BleakError as e:
        logger.debug(f"BLE error during {operation}: {e}")
        raise self.BLEError(f"Bluetooth error during {operation}") from e
    except (RuntimeError, OSError) as e:
        logger.debug(f"System error during {operation}: {e}")
        raise self.BLEError(f"System error during {operation}") from e
    except Exception as e:
        logger.exception(f"Unexpected error during {operation}")
        raise self.BLEError(f"Unexpected error during {operation}") from e

def _safe_cleanup(self, operation: str, func, *args, **kwargs) -> None:
    """
    Safely execute cleanup operation, logging but ignoring errors.
    """
    try:
        func(*args, **kwargs)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.debug(f"Ignoring error during {operation} cleanup: {e}")
```

**Usage:**
```python
def _safe_close_client(self, client: "BLEClient") -> None:
    self._safe_cleanup("client close", client.close)

def connect(self, address: Optional[str] = None) -> "BLEClient":
    return self._safe_execute("connection", self._do_connect, address)
```

### Phase 4: Thread Management Simplification

#### 4.1 Consolidate Thread Coordination

**Current Approach:**
```python
self._read_trigger: Event = Event()      # Signals when data is available to read
self._reconnected_event: Event = Event() # Signals when reconnection occurred
self._reconnect_thread: Optional[Thread] = None
```

**Refactored Approach:**
```python
class ThreadCoordinator:
    """Simplified thread coordination for BLE operations."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self._stop_event = Event()
        self._data_ready = Event()
        
    def stop(self) -> None:
        self._stop_event.set()
        self._data_ready.set()  # Wake any waiting threads
        
    @property
    def should_stop(self) -> bool:
        return self._stop_event.is_set()
        
    def wait_for_data(self, timeout: float) -> bool:
        """Wait for data or stop signal."""
        return self._data_ready.wait(timeout=timeout) and not self.should_stop
        
    def signal_data(self) -> None:
        self._data_ready.set()
```

### Phase 5: Constants and Configuration Consolidation

#### 5.1 Group Related Constants

**Current Approach:**
```python
DISCONNECT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 5.0
RECEIVE_THREAD_JOIN_TIMEOUT = 2.0
EVENT_THREAD_JOIN_TIMEOUT = 2.0

BLE_SCAN_TIMEOUT = 10.0
RECEIVE_WAIT_TIMEOUT = 0.5
EMPTY_READ_RETRY_DELAY = 0.1
EMPTY_READ_MAX_RETRIES = 5
SEND_PROPAGATION_DELAY = 0.01
CONNECTION_TIMEOUT = 60.0
AUTO_RECONNECT_INITIAL_DELAY = 1.0
AUTO_RECONNECT_MAX_DELAY = 30.0
AUTO_RECONNECT_BACKOFF = 2.0
```

**Refactored Approach:**
```python
@dataclass
class BLEConfig:
    """Consolidated BLE configuration."""
    
    # Timeout values (seconds)
    disconnect_timeout: float = 5.0
    thread_join_timeout: float = 2.0
    scan_timeout: float = 10.0
    receive_wait_timeout: float = 0.5
    connection_timeout: float = 60.0
    
    # Retry configuration
    empty_read_retry_delay: float = 0.1
    empty_read_max_retries: int = 5
    send_propagation_delay: float = 0.01
    
    # Auto-reconnect configuration
    auto_reconnect_initial_delay: float = 1.0
    auto_reconnect_max_delay: float = 30.0
    auto_reconnect_backoff: float = 2.0
    
    # Thresholds
    malformed_notification_threshold: int = 10

# Usage
config = BLEConfig()
```

### Phase 6: Method Consolidation

#### 6.1 Merge Similar Methods

**Current Methods to Consolidate:**
- `_on_ble_disconnect()` + `_handle_read_loop_disconnect()` → `_handle_disconnect()`
- `_schedule_auto_reconnect()` + `_reconnect_with_backoff()` → `_start_reconnection()`
- Multiple small error handling methods → `_safe_execute()` and `_safe_cleanup()`

#### 6.2 Simplify Receive Loop

**Current Approach:**
```python
def _receiveFromRadioImpl(self) -> None:
    # 100+ lines of complex retry logic, error handling, state management
```

**Refactored Approach:**
```python
def _receiveFromRadioImpl(self) -> None:
    """Simplified receive loop with helper methods."""
    while not self._coordinator.should_stop and self.should_receive:
        try:
            if not self._coordinator.wait_for_data(config.receive_wait_timeout):
                continue
                
            data = self._read_from_client()
            if data:
                self._handleFromRadio(data)
                
        except Exception as e:
            if self._should_handle_receive_error(e):
                self._handle_receive_error(e)
            else:
                raise

def _read_from_client(self) -> Optional[bytes]:
    """Read data from current client with retry logic."""
    # Extracted retry logic into focused method
    pass

def _should_handle_receive_error(self, error: Exception) -> bool:
    """Determine if error should be handled or re-raised."""
    # Centralized error classification
    pass
```
